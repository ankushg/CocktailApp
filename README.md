# [WIP] CocktailApp

A work in progress Kotlin Multiplatform client for [TheCocktailDB](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/).

Originally based off of the [KaMPKit](https://github.com/touchlab/KaMPKit/) starter repo.

The goal is to use Jetpack Compose and SwiftUI to create clients for Android and iOS (and maybe more!)
